# Positive-Edge-Triggered-D-Flip-Flop-Design-65nm-
A custom VLSI implementation of a D Flip-Flop using 65nm CMOS technology. This project covers the full design flow from schematic to physical layout, verified via DRC/LVS. It includes rigorous HSPICE characterization for Setup Time, Hold Time, Clock-to-Q delay, and Power consumption under a 45fF load.
